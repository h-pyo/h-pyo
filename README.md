### Hello there!! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harris Pyo and I am a graduate student studying Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I previously worked at Merck & Co., Inc. as a Software Engineer Intern this past summer 2024 and will continue working part-time throughout the semester. I am working towards becoming a full-stack developer and always eager to learn something new and meet new people!
